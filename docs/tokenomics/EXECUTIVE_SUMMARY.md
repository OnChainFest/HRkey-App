# HRKey Token (HRK) - Executive Summary
## Tokenomics Overview for Investors & Partners

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** November 2025 | **Network:** Base L2

---

## The Opportunity

**Problem**: $50B annual spend on background checks and recruiting relies on unverified, incentive-misaligned, and easily fabricated professional references.

**Solution**: HRKey transforms professional references into **verifiable, market-priced digital assets** secured by cryptographic proof and economic incentives.

**Market**: 500M global workforce → 10M early adopters (2%) → $2B protocol revenue at scale.

## HRK Token at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 1,000,000,000 HRK (fixed) |
| **Token Standard** | ERC-20 (Base L2) |
| **Primary Network** | Base (Ethereum L2) |
| **Secondary Network** | Solana (Phase 2) |
| **TGE Price** | $0.10/HRK |
| **Initial Market Cap** | $11M (11% circulating) |
| **FDV** | $100M |
| **Query Price Range** | 5-500 HRK ($2.50-$250) |

---

## Core Value Drivers

### 1. Dynamic Pricing Mechanism

Professional references are **not commodities**. HRKey prices each candidate's data based on:

```
Price = Base × Seniority × Demand × Skill_Rarity × HRScore × Geography × Industry
```

**Example:**
- Junior Developer (2 YoE, average demand): **15 HRK** ($7.50)
- Senior ML Engineer (10 YoE, high demand): **120 HRK** ($60)

This creates a **market-driven data economy** where value reflects actual hiring utility.

### 2. Proof-of-Feedback (PoF)

Evaluators (managers, colleagues) **stake HRK** to submit references. They earn:

- **20% of query revenue** (passive income per reference)
- **5-20% APY** on staked tokens
- **Quality bonuses** for high-correlation feedback

**Slashing** (10-100% of stake) punishes fraud, creating **game-theoretic honesty**.

### 3. Three-Sided Network Effects

```
More Candidates → More Evaluators → More Data → Higher Employer Demand
                                                         ↓
                                            Increased Token Utility & Price
```

**Metcalfe's Law** applies: Value ∝ (Users)^1.5

| Year | Candidates | Evaluators | Employers | Protocol Value |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 100K | 10K | 1K | $3.2M |
| 3 | 2M | 200K | 20K | $1.1B |
| 5 | 10M | 1M | 100K | $31.6B |

### 4. Deflationary Mechanics

**Continuous Burns:**
- 1% of every transaction → burned
- High-demand profiles → 5% bonus burn
- Slashed stakes → 50% burned

**5-Year Projection**: 36.5% of supply burned (635M effective supply).

---

## Token Utility (7 Core Functions)

1. **Payment for Queries**: Employers pay HRK to access verified references
2. **Evaluator Staking**: Anti-fraud collateral (100-10,000 HRK tiers)
3. **Rewards Distribution**: Evaluators earn HRK for quality feedback
4. **Slashing Mechanism**: Economic deterrent against fraud
5. **Employer Discounts**: Stake HRK for 5-40% query discounts
6. **Governance**: DAO voting on protocol upgrades
7. **Premium Access**: API access, analytics dashboards, white-label solutions

| **Liquidity** | 80M | 8% | Immediate (locked 12M) |
| **Private Sale** | 70M | 7% | 18M linear, 6M cliff |
| **Public Sale (TGE)** | 30M | 3% | Immediate |
| **Grants** | 20M | 2% | 36 months linear |
| **TOTAL** | **1,000M** | **100%** | |

**Circulating Supply:**
- TGE: 11% (110M HRK)
- Month 12: 26% (260M)
- Month 24: 45% (450M)
- Month 48: 100% (1,000M)

## Revenue Model

### Per-Query Revenue Split

```
Employer pays 20 HRK per query
├─ 40% (8 HRK) → Candidate (data owner)
├─ 40% (8 HRK) → HRKey Treasury
└─ 20% (4 HRK) → Evaluator (reference creator)
```

### Year 1-5 Revenue Projection

| Year | Queries | Avg Price | Gross Rev | Treasury (40%) | Net to HRKey |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | 10M | 20 HRK | $100M | $40M | $20M (50% ops) |
| 2 | 50M | 25 HRK | $625M | $250M | $125M |
| 3 | 150M | 30 HRK | $2.25B | $900M | $450M |
| 5 | 500M | 40 HRK | $10B | $4B | $2B |

**Assumptions**: $0.50/HRK stable price (conservative).

---

## Staking Economics

### Evaluator Tiers

| Tier | Stake | Max Evals/Mo | Base APY | Cooldown |
|------|-------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Bronze** | 100 HRK | 20 | 5% | 7 days |
| **Silver** | 500 HRK | 100 | 8% | 14 days |
| **Gold** | 2,000 HRK | Unlimited | 12% | 30 days |
| **Platinum** | 10,000 HRK | Unlimited | 15% | 90 days |

**Enhanced APY**: Quality + volume + lockup multipliers → up to **40% APY** for elite evaluators.

### Employer Volume Discounts

| Staked HRK | Discount | ROI Example |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 1,000 | 5% | Break-even at 400 queries/year |
| 5,000 | 10% | Break-even at 200 queries/year |
| 20,000 | 20% | Break-even at 100 queries/year |
| 100,000 | 30% | Enterprises (1,000+ queries) |
| 500,000+ | 40% | ATS platforms, staffing agencies |

---

## Slashing: Economic Security

### Fraud Penalties

| Violation | Slash % | Examples |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | 10% | Poor correlation (<0.20) for 3 months |
| **Tier 2** | 30% | Unverified identities, missed deadlines |
| **Tier 3** | 60% | Collusion, repeated violations |
| **Tier 4** | 100% | Proven fraud, identity impersonation |

**Slash Distribution:**
- 50% → Burned (deflationary)
- 50% → Redistributed to honest evaluators

**Appeals**: 48-hour window + DAO arbitration for disputed slashes.

**Expected Value Analysis**:
- Honest evaluator EV: **+$12,200/year** (500 HRK stake)
- Fraudulent evaluator EV: **-$693/year** (accounting for detection + future loss)

**Result**: Honesty is **economically dominant strategy** by ~10x margin.

- Predicts job performance with 0.75+ correlation
- Continuous improvement via feedback loops

### 2. Data Network Effects
- Every reference strengthens the algorithm
- Evaluator reputation compounds over time
- Employers locked in by proprietary insights

### 3. Economic Security Model
- Staking + slashing = cryptographic trust
- No competitor has game-theoretic fraud prevention
- First-mover advantage in Web3 labor data

### 4. Regulatory Compliance

## Valuation & Comparables

### Comparable Projects (FDV)

| Project | FDV | Use Case | HRKey Comparison |
|---------|-----|----------|------------------|
| **Worldcoin** | $30B | Identity | HRKey adds labor layer |
| **Helium** | $8B | Decentralized infra | Similar PoF mechanism |
| **Arweave** | $2B | Data storage | Permanent labor records |
| **The Graph** | $3B | Data indexing | Labor data oracle |

### HRKey Target Valuation

| Scenario | FDV | Price/HRK | Timeline |
|----------|-----|-----------|----------|
| **Conservative** | $500M | $0.50 | Year 2 |
| **Base Case** | $2B | $2.00 | Year 3 |
| **Bull Case** | $5B | $5.00 | Year 5 |

**Justification**:
- Year 3 protocol revenue: $900M (treasury)
- 5x revenue multiple (industry standard) = $4.5B FDV
- **Base case = $2B is 2.2x revenue (conservative)**
